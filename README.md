# Automobile-Visualisations-Assignment

This assignment was based around making graphical representations of data using Seaborn, Folium & Matplotlib to give key insights into how automobile sales trends in recessions and non_recession periods

**Objectives**

*After passing this assignment I am able to:*

1.Create informative and visually appealing plots with Matplotlib and Seaborn.

2.Apply visualization to communicate insights from the data.

3.Analyze data through using visualizations.

4.Customize visualizations

**Setup**

*I used the following libraries:*

1.pandas for managing the data.

2.numpy for mathematical operations.

3.matplotlib for plotting.

4.seaborn for plotting.

5.Folium for plotting.
